# Documentation

## notes
*utils\qrcode_core\lib.rs*
```
@AtomicGamer9523 has a lot of documentation already dome for this specific file. @Phbar1945 will use this to create line-specific comments, detailing what each function does in the case that specific values might have to be changed/modified by a user who is not familiar with the rust programing language.
```
*general*
```
Most files have very general documentation. @Phbar1945 is adding specific documentation, usually adding a sort of explaination for each line of code, with exceptions for special cases. Goal is to have similar if not higher levels of in-code documentaton as NASA had in the lunar lander for apollo 11.
